                <p>WHERE WE SURECASE THE BEST CARS WITH AFFORDABLE PRICES</p>
                <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
 Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people,
 have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods</p>
                <p>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.
 The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz
 Patent-Motorwagen.Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to
 the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
 Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.In Europe and other
 parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II</p>
                 <p>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights.
 Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively
 more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate.[citation needed] These include rear-reversing
 cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s
 are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars,
 which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and
 are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.The transition from fossil fuels
 to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,such as Project 
 Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change</p>
